# Bridge
A self-managing bridge system dedicated to allow server owners and plugin developers communicate between the server network, directly. It uses Rust's network reading/writing with the only difference being, this allows you to communicate with one or multiple servers at once.

<CarbonButton href="https://github.com/CarbonCommunity/Carbon.Common/blob/develop/src/Carbon/Components/Bridge.cs" icon="code" text="Source Code" external/>

## Server
At its core, it uses `Fleck` (AKA Facepunch `RCon`'s listener). It's entirely independent to Rust's `RCon` system, it just uses the core components at base (connection and memory management, etc.).

:::tip USEFUL
Carbon attempts to boot up **Carbon.Bridge** right before Rust's `RCon` attempts to get online. It looks for `-bridge.ip` [optional], `-bridge-port` [optional] and `-bridge.password` [required]. 

> By default, **the Bridge server won't boot**, unless the password is set in the command-line.

```csharp
Carbon.Components.Bridge.Server.Start(
    port: Carbon.Switches.GetBridgePort(defaultValue: $"{RCon.Port + 1}").ToInt(),
    password: Carbon.Switches.GetBridgePassword(defaultValue: "unset"),
    ip: Carbon.Switches.GetBridgeIp());
```
:::

## Client
A simple client websocket connector. Designed to connect to `BridgeServer` infrastructure and easily understand/communicate Bridge messages back and forth.

You can create multiple `BridgeClient` connections to many of your servers, as necessary.

This class is as straightforward as it gets. It connects to the server, disconnects from it when you choose to or the server goes down, and sends a data packet in the form of `BridgeWrite`, while listening to incoming server packets to ensure that back-n-forth communication. 

## Messages
A default message set for the bridge events and channels. **Carbon.Bridge** comes with the following channels you can use for various things.

:::tip
- `OnRpc(BridgeRead read)` — Designed to execute methods the same way Rust entities do.
- `OnCommand(BridgeRead read)` — Handles events such as commands with arguments and such.
- `OnCustom(BridgeRead read)` — Completely custom or separate handling of packets, designed the way you want.
- `OnUnhandled(BridgeRead read)` — These are leftover events, to ensure there's no spilling of packets. 
:::

## Example
Here's a fully working example of how this whole thing works. It's a good starting point too. Just follow summaries and don't let yourself be overwhelmed, it's actually easier than you think.

:::info OUTPUT
This is the output of the following code:

```
Loaded plugin BridgeExample v1.0.0 by Carbon Community [113ms]

Mrs Manuela has 43.7% chance of survival! [Client] [Thread Pool Worker|82]
