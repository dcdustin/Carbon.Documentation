# Profiler (Mono)

A high-speed, lightweight Mono profiler written in Rust, designed to profile game assemblies, Carbon,
plugins, modules & extensions at high depth.

:::danger JUST IN
We now provide a standalone version of the Carbon profiler, that **doesn't** require you to run Carbon to use, **optimized to work in Rust vanilla or Oxide environments**. 

You can export all profiles made using it to JSON, CSV or Proto, which you can view or load up in a Carbon server by importing the profiler through the UI. [Learn more.](https://github.com/CarbonCommunity/Carbon.Profiler)

## Introduction

![Mono Profiler Header](/misc/mono-profiler-header.webp)

The Mono Profiler is a Carbon built-in feature, offering high performance and convenience, making it ideal for profiling
the game, plugins, and more - efficiently.

:::info ✅ You may profile the following:

* **Game assemblies** (Assembly-CSharp, Facepunch.\*, Rust.\*, Unity\*, System, etc.)
* **Carbon assemblies** (Carbon.Common, Carbon.Compat, etc.)
* **Plugin assemblies**
* **Module assemblies**
* **Extension assemblies**

Search for `c.profile` in the [Commands reference](../../references/commands) index for an up-to-date list of profiler
commands

## Config

The configuration for the profiler is located at `carbon/config.profiler.json`.

::: code-group

```json [config.profiler.json]
{
  // Disabling it will shut it off entirely
  "Enabled": true,
  // Keeps track of all calls for assemblies and methods
  "TrackCalls": true,
  // Disabled by default, allows authorized users to access the Admin module
  // profiler source viewer and view source code of called methods
  "SourceViewer": true,
  // All assemblies and libraries (Rust, Carbon, libs..)
  // Enabling all (*) assemblines, will bypass the categories below
  "Assemblies": [
    "Assembly-CSharp",
    "Assembly-CSharp-firstpass"
  ],
  // All .cs and .cszip plugins
  "Plugins": [
    "*"
  ],
  // All modules from carbon/managed/modules directory
  "Modules": [
    "*"
  ],
  // All extensions from carbon/extensions directory
  "Extensions": [
    "Carbon.Ext.MyExtension"
  ],
  // All Harmony mods from carbon/harmony directory
  "Harmony": []
}
```

:::tip Note
To enable profiling with full selection for one or more categories, use a wildcard/star ( `*` ).

:::danger Important
Remove the `//` comments from the JSON above if you're willing to override it locally with it.

## Getting Started

### Profiler Flags

They're used when starting or stopping the profiler when processing is executed.

:::info Tip
If the `Calls` flag is **NOT** set, only memory allocations will be profiled.
:::

### `Abort`

When the profiler is recording, this flag will terminate recording and discard collected stack and data processed
natively.

### `Memory`

Requires the `Calls` flag to be set. The profiler will keep track of the memory of each call in the stack.

### `Timings`

:::danger Important
**This flag will significantly affect performance due to having to calculate the time taken on each call.**
:::
Requires the `Calls` flag to be set. The profiler will keep track of the timing & duration information for each call in
the stack.

### `Calls`

Whether method calls should be tracked by the current stack.
