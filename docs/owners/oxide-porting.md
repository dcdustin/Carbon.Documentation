## Automatic

Carbon has a built-in process which detects an existent Oxide installation and upon clean Carbon install (patch unzipped
in the server root directory), will appropriately move all extensions found in `RustDedicated_Data/Managed` previously
used with Oxide, in Carbon's dedicated directory.

Carbon also copies all config, data, lang, user & group data files and migrates it all at launch of the server, after
files have been validated with Steam, since they're still patched with Oxide.

:::tip
Ensure you validate all server files before initially starting up the server with Carbon for a clean boot. If things
don't update, delete `steamapps` directory from the root of the folder first.
:::

## Manual

To understand changes necessary for handling things manually, follow the following instructions.

:::info Config Folder
The `<root>/oxide/config` folder **becomes `<root>/carbon/configs`**. This is because early in the development of
Carbon, we've named it that way since it makes more sense.
:::

### Extensions

The Oxide extensions, which in Oxide (for some reason) you place then in the brain folder of your Rust server, aka
`RustDedicated_Data/Managed`, **in Carbon it goes in its own dedicated directory, namely `<root>/carbon/extensions`**.

If you need help to identify what an Oxide extension looks like in your files, any file with `Oxide.Ext.*.dll` format
would be found in the Managed folder of an Oxide server.

:::danger Oxide (o.*) Commands
They don't work, this is Carbon. It might be difficult to get used to it, but all our commands are prefixed with c.*.
Although you may create aliases which reflect commands.

Look for `alias` in the Commands page. [Read more here.](../references/commands/)
:::

## Successful Transfer

There's a requirement where you must delete all `Oxide.*.dll` from your `<root>/RustDedicated_Data/Managed` folder, as
well as verifying and re-updating your Rust server so files like `Assembly-CSharp.dll` get redownloaded, since Oxide
processes them.

Take all extensions out of your `<root>/RustDedicated_Data/Managed` directory, and putting them in the respective Carbon
extensions folder, removing Managed folder altogether, then performing an update & validation with steamcmd. This
ensures that your server is cleansed and vanilla.
