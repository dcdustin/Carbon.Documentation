# Vanish Module

The Vanish Module is an **optional Carbon module** that enables administrators or moderators to toggle invisibility for
players. It prevents detection by other players, AI, and server-side mechanics like helicopters or turrets. This module
includes UI feedback, sound effects, and permission-controlled behavior.

> **Note:** Vanish is highly customizable and designed to respect permission layers. It does not affect player
> persistence unless configured to.

## Overview

- **Class Name:** `VanishModule`

When a player is vanished, they become invisible, unattackable, and undetectable by most game systems and AI.
Reappearance restores normal status.

The Vanish Module is ideal for admins needing to monitor players stealthily, moderate without interference, or perform
cinematic recordings.

- `void OnCarbonUnvanished(BasePlayer player)` when players unvanish
