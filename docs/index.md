    icon: üéØ
  - title: Scalability
    details: Carbon super lightweight by only providing the very essential hooks needed, keeping things vanilla when there are no changes made by plugins.

  - title: Permissions
    details: We have created a more optimized modular permission system that allows for users to create their own serializers. <a class="textLink" href="/devs/features/permissions">Learn more</a>
